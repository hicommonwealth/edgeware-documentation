# Why Develop on Edgeware

## Edgeware is Live!

Edgeware launched in February of 2020 as the first smart-contract chain with a live mainnet. The network has transitioned through three on-chain upgrades. You can deploy your contracts to Edgeware today!

## Live Full EVM + WASM Contract runtime

Edgeware has [deployed Full EVM compatibility layer](https://github.com/hicommonwealth/evm/blob/master/README.md) and tooling support. On top of that you can deploy WASM Contracts written in ink!, AssemblyScript.
