# FAQ

**How do I retrieve my ETH after the Lockdrop is over?**

[Use the Unlock tool at Commonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/#!/unlock)

[Read the full instructions at blog.edgewa.re](https://blog.edgewa.re/luc-101-retrieving-your-eth-from-the-lockdrop-contract/)

To get your ETH back from a Lockdrop User Contract, once your lock duration has ended, send a zero-value or greater transaction from any account to the contract address of the LUC.

The LUC will then return the ETH to the original address that sent this ETH to the Master Lockdrop Contract at the start of the Lockdrop Event. [Read a longer, detailed explanation at Blog.edgewa.re](https://blog.edgewa.re/luc-101-retrieving-your-eth-from-the-lockdrop-contract/)

**How many EDG will be minted in the genesis lockdrop event?**

The genesis of the Edgeware network will mint 5 Billion EDG tokens.

Of this 5 Billion, 90%, or 4.5 billion will be distributed through the lockdrop process. The 10% remainder is distributed to:

4.5% to Commonwealth Labs, the developers of Edgeware, and will not be used to fund development. 3% to Parity Tech for support services on their Substrate product. 2.5% reserved for Community Incentives, OSS development, or other network success goals.

For the 90% distributed in the Lockdrop Event, lockdrop participants obtain 'shares' or the ability to obtain EDG at a certain proportion to their locked or signaled ETH. The following chart shows these share weights:

| Duration of Lock | Method | Weighting | EDG Received |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 months | Signal | 0.20x | 25% at launch, 75% 265 days later |
| 3 months | Lock | 1.00x | Upon Network Launch |
| 6 months | Lock | 1.30x | Upon Network Launch |
| 12 months | Lock | 2.20x | Upon Network Launch |

Ones final shares are a proportion of the 90%, not a determinate value until the lockdrop closes and the total amount of locked ETH are known. One can earn greater share weights through locking for longer durations, or locking earlier.

**How do DOTs interact with EDG?**

1. Initially, Edgeware is being launched as an independent chain \("solochain"\). This means that EDG will be used as the bonding and reward token for validators.
2. When Polkadot launches, Edgeware will be eligible to become a parachain. DOTs are used to provide shared security and for inter-parachain communication in the Polkadot Network, so if and when Edgeware becomes a Polkadot parachain, for the duration of that parachain status, it will not have validators for the state of finality of its own , but rather that validation will happen through the Polkadot relaychain's validator pool. However, EDG will still be used for gas fees, spam prevention, and bonding for on-chain activities \(e.g. governance\).
3. In the future, the network may vote to make Edgeware a relay chain, just like Polkadot. In this case, EDG may be used to provide security for child parachains.
