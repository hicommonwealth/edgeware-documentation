# Create Multi Signature Account

In this chapter we will create a Multi-Signature account and perform a test transaction from the account.

You will go to the [Accounts in Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts)

![create-ms-account](../../.gitbook/assets/create-ms-account.png)

You will choose your signatures, i.e. your team mates accounts, in our scenario we choose **Alice, Bob and Charlie**. We set **threshold to 2**, that means there is only needed signature from **two of three**. You can set threshold to be less or equal to the number of signatories for multisig. We call it our **Team Funding** account.

![create-choose-signatures](../../.gitbook/assets/create-choose-signatures.png)

Now we will top-up **1,000,000** tEDG to the **Team Funding** multi-signature account from **Alice**. Thank you Alice!

## Create Transfer from Multi-Signature Account

Now that the **Team Funding** account has been seeded, we can pay **DAVE** **200,000** tEDG for completion of a project. In our accounts list, hit **Send** from our **Team Funding** account

![transfer-ms](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer-ms%20%281%29%20%281%29.png)

Now we are prompted \(**as ALICE**\) to authorize transaction.

You will see there `multisig call data` with payload `0x0603ff306721211d5404bd9da88e0204360a1a9ab8b87c66c1bc2fcdd37f3c2222cc201b000000ed95c28f055a2a` which is call data that can be supplied to a final call to multi approvals. It's what triggers chain logic to execute commands. You will hit Sign and Submit.

![transfer-ms-authorize-tx.png](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer-ms-authorize-tx.png)

It was broadcasted to the chain, you can see notification on the top right.

![multi-signature-first-call](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer-ms-first-call.png)

Now we click on the right three dots next to our **Team Funding** account as there is multisig approvals pending \(_red dot_\) and select **Send**

![multi-signature-second-call](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer-ms-second-call.png)

You as other signator \(**BOB**\) enter same amount and destination to **get same final call payload**.

![multi-signature-transfer](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer-ms%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.png)

Now we as **BOB** we can authorize transaction. UI is smart enough and detected it's final approval. Under toggle _Multisig message_ you will see same payload as we're creating multisig transaction. Hit Sign and Submit and it's should be signed 2 of 3 signatories which is enough for this scenario so can transaction can pass through to DAVE.

![multi-signature-call-confirm](../../.gitbook/assets/transfer-ms-second-call-confirm.png)

Woala, DAVE has money, **funds secured** on his account.

You've managed to learn how to make transaction for multi-signature. Multisignature has broad usecase and you can leverage final call for your use case to trigger what ever you want on chain.
