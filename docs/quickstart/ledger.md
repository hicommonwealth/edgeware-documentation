## Trouble Shooting

1. Make sure you are using a **chromium-based browser** like google chrome or brave.
2. **If your ledger is not being recognized** you may have to open a new tab or window when connecting your ledger you can do this by right-clicking and open in new window or tab. Another solution you may have to change settings in polkadot apps. Under manage hardware connections have it set to “Do not attach Ledger device” then click save. You can’t use the Ledger device on polkadot apps and the web extension at the same time.
