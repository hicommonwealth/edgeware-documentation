## Stash and Controller accounts

* It is recommended to use two different accounts for Stash and Controller but not mandatory.
* Think of the Stash account as the the cold storage wallet with the funds.
* Think of the Controller account as a hot wallet that acts on behalf of the Stash account.
* Create the accounts and allocate EDG accordingly.

* Choose the validators you want to nominate. (You can pick more than one, in fact it is a good idea to do so. If the validator you nominated becomes inactive you will not be earning rewards. Do your due diligence when choosing validators) Want to learn more click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3IoHHxZoX0\&t=311s) for a good explanation. 
* Click Bond & Nominate.

* Click sign and submit (enter password).
* Bonding duration is 14 days. Meaning when you want to claim your EDG you have to first unbond them. Once this is done you have to wait 14 days to be able to claim them.

## Stashes

* Click on Account actions and you will see your active stash accounts and other information.
* To stop staking and start unbonding click stop.
* If you click on the menu beside stop you will see other options for your stash account.
