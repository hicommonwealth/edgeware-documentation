# Smart Contracts

## Introduction to the Edgeware Contracts Workshop

Edgeware is blockchain platform with support [WASM Contracts Pallet](wasm-smart-contracts/README.md) and [EVM Ethereum compatibility layer.](evm-smart-contracts/README.md)

This is a self-guided tutorial which will teach you how to build both [WASM](https://webassembly.org/) and EVM-based smart contracts on [Edgeware](https://github.com/hicommonwealth/edgeware-node).

In the WASM tutorials, we will cover:

1. Installing prerequisites on your computer
2. Using the ink! CLI to start a new project
3. Building and testing your contract
4. Deploying your contract on a local Edgeware node
5. Interacting with your contract using the Polkadot UI
6. Creating a basic flipper contract
7. Creating a simple incrementer contract
8. Creating a more complex ERC20 contract
9. Implement the [PSP22 Token Standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/psp-22.md) to a contract - with [OpenBrush](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts) implementation

In the [EVM tutorials](https://docs.edgeware.wiki/development/develop/smart-contracts/evm-smart-contracts/tutorials), we will cover:

1. Setting up an Edgeware node
2. Setting up Metamask to work with Edgeware
3. Using Remix as an Ethereum IDE to compile, deploy, and call a contract
4. Using Truffle to deploy a contract to Edgeware
5. Using Web3.js to interact with Edgeware contracts programmatically

We would love for you to give feedback in these early stages, so please feel free to open a PR or comment on Commonwealth!
