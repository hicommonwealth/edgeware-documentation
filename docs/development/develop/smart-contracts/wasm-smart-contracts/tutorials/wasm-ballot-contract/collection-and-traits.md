# Collection and Traits

In this part, we will be using the structs built previously and write public functions to add and fetch data from our contract.

## Collections <a id="collections"></a>

For this contract, we are going to store our voters in a HashMap with `AccountId` as a key and `Voter` instance as value. The HashMap can be imported from the `ink_storage` crate by:

```rust
use ink_storage::collections::HashMap;
```

The proposals will be stored in a `Vec` collection that can be imported from the `ink_prelude` crate. `ink_prelude` is a collection of data structures that operate on contract memory during contract execution. The vector can be imported by:

```rust
    use ink_prelude::vec::Vec;
```

Vectors can be instantiated in the same way as a HashMap. New objects can be added or referenced to from a vector using:

```rust
    let proposals: Vec<proposals> = Vec::new();
    // adding a new proposal
    proposals.push(
        Proposal{
            name:String::from("Proposal # 1"),
            vote_count: 0,
        });
    // returns the proposal at index 0 if exists else returns None
    let proposal = self.proposals.get(0).unwrap();
```

Remember that the `vector.get` returns an `Option` not the actual object!

## Traits <a id="traits"></a>

A trait tells the Rust compiler about the functionality a particular type has, and can be shared with other types. You can read more about them [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html). Before using the custom built structures inside the `Ballot` storage, certain traits are required to be implemented for `Voter` and `Proposal` structs. These traits include:

* `Debug`: Allows debug formatting in format strings
* `Clone` : This trait allows you to create a deep copy of object
* `Copy` : The copy traits allows you to copy a value of a field
* `PackedLayout`: Types that can be stored to and loaded from a single contract storage cell
* `SpreadLayout`: Types that can be stored to and loaded from the contract storage.

You can learn more about these traits over [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-03-derivable-traits.html) and [here](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/ink_storage/traits/index.html). These traits are implemented using the `derive` attribute:

```rust
    #[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, scale::Encode, scale::Decode, SpreadLayout, PackedLayout, scale_info::TypeInfo)]
    struct XYZ {
        ...
        ...
    }
```

## Your Turn! <a id="your-turn"></a>

You need to:

* Create a proposal Vec and voters HashMap in Ballot struct.
* Update the constructor, so that it initializes a Vec of proposals and a HashMap of voters. Also update the voters HashMap to include the chair person as a voter.
* Create getters for both storage items.
* Write `add_voter` function to create a voter by the given `AccountId` and insert it in the HashMap of voters.
* Write `add_proposal` function that creates a `Proposal` object and inserts it tot he vector of proposals.

Remember to run `cargo +nightly test` to test your work.
